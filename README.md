# What-Is-This
This is a mine sweeper game written in java.<br>
It also has these properties:<br>
	1) making new game<br>
	2) showing the number of bombs<br>
	3) changing theme<br>
	4) changing difficulty<br>
	5) changing game's mode<br>

Caution:<br>
As you see, there is two different projects. The "MineSweeperPaint" is the MineSweeper which actually uses paintComponent. The other one is only with buttons. The reason I made both of them, is that I first made the paint version and noticed any time I press new game or change the prefrences, it blinks and shows the solution. The benefit that the paint version has, is that it's faster than the other one.<br>

Caution2:<br>
In each folder there is a python file which can run the package if you have added java to your system path. (This file is also avaible in Java-Runner repository).<br>
If you have python 3 installed on your pc, then you can use it :)
